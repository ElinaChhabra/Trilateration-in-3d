# Trilateration-in-3d

Python program that implements trilateration in 3 dimensions. The objective is to find location of a point in space based on the location(co-ordinates) of 4 other points in space and the distance of the unknown point from these 4 known points. The data files contain the co-ordinates of the 4 points in 3D and their distance from the unknown point. We do this by solving the equations of three spheres generated in 3D and narrowing down on the point of intersection using the equation of 4th sphere.
